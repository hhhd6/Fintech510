# Read Two - Vectors

1. Create a file `answer.txt`.
2. Execute the code under the instructions by hand as demonstrated with the 
   memory/trace diagrams in class. Write the output in your `answer.txt` file
3. Take a picture of your diagram.
4. Copy the source code into a file `read2_string.cpp` and change it to work 
   with the following data:
   ```c++
   vector<string> data = {"Duke", "University", "FinTech", "510"};
   ```
   You will need to change the type in several locations to make the code work.

5. After compiling and running `read2_string.cpp`, add its output to your
   `answer.txt` file.
6. Submit `answer.txt`, `read2_string.cpp`, and your diagram (this can be 
   png/jpg/pdf) for grading in gradescope.
   
   Please note the correct file names to submit.


## Notes

- In C++, the size of vectors are unsigned integers - the size cannot be 
  negative. So, rather than using int as the type to store the size of the 
  vector and for index variables, we need to use a special alias `std::size_t`
  for these variable types.  
  
  In the code below, we do not need to use the `std::` prefix as that namespace
  has been import into the scope of the source file with using namespace std;.

- This code file uses two styles of for loops: a "for each" loop and a 
  traditional C/C++ "for" loop.  The "for each" loop in `someFunction` equates 
  to the "for" loop used with Python.  Also, notice that the keyword auto
  defines the variable type. The C++ compiler can appropriately infer that 
  we are tracking a vector of integers(ints), the type should be `int`.

- `endl` is a special constant used to represent the newline character, 
  which can be platform-dependent. This constant also flushes the stream, 
  forcing all output to be written.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void someFunction(vector<int> vec) {
  for (auto value : vec) {
    cout << value << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

vector<int> anotherFunction(vector<int> vec) {
  for (size_t step = 0; step < vec.size() - 1; step++) {
    size_t min_idx = step;
    for (size_t i = step + 1; i < vec.size(); i++) {

      if (vec[i] > vec[min_idx])
        min_idx = i;
    }

    int temp = vec[min_idx];
    vec[min_idx] = vec[step];
    vec[step] = temp;
  }
  return vec;
}

int main(void) {
  vector<int> data = {5, 6, 4, 7, 3};
  vector<int> revised_data = anotherFunction(data);
  someFunction(revised_data);
}
```
