# Reverse 

For this problem, you will write the function
```
void reverse(string &str) 
```
in the provided `reverse.cpp` file.  

This function should reverse the string passed into it (that is, if given "abc", 
it should change the contents of that string to read "cba"). 

Note that this function's return type is "void" --- it modifies the string passed into it in place. For C++, this requires passing a reference to the string, otherwise a copy will be passed and modified.

`reverse.cpp` contains a main function which you can use to test your
reverse function.  The correct output for your program can be found in reverse_ans.txt, 
so you can diff your program's output against that file.

Submit `reverse.cpp` to the Gradescope assignment.
