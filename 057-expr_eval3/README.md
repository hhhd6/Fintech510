# Expressions - Part Three

For this part, declare this abstract method in Expression:
```
long evaluate() const = 0;
```
and implement it in each concrete subclass of Expression.

## Submission
Once you have tested and validated the functionality for part 3, 
submit `expr.cpp` and `expr.hpp` to Gradescope.
