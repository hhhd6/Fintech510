# Binary Search Tree
Binary search trees (BSTs) are a type of data structure that facilitate efficient 
searching, insertion, and deletion of data. Some Key characteristics:

- _Node Structure_: Each node in a BST has up to three components: a value, 
  a left child, and a right child.
- _Ordered Arrangement_: In a BST, the left child of a node always contains a 
  value less than its parent node, and the right child contains a value greater 
  than its parent. This ordering applies recursively to all nodes in the tree.
- _Search Efficiency_: Searching in a BST is fast. Starting from the root, you 
  compare the search value with the current node's value and traverse left or 
  right accordingly, significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed 
  compared to linear data structures like arrays.
- _Balanced vs. Unbalanced Trees_: A balanced BST, where the left and right 
  subtrees of any node differ in height by no more than one, ensures that 
  operations remain efficient. Unbalanced trees can degrade to linked lists in 
  the worst case, leading to slower operations.
- _Traversal Methods_: BSTs support several traversal methods:
  - _In-order_(left, node, right): Processes elements in sorted order
  - _Pre-order_(node, left, right): Useful when cloning a tree or processing 
    prefixed notation expressions
  - _Post-order_(left, right, node): Useful when the results of the children 
    need to be computed in the current node's computation. Also used when deleting 
    (freeing) nodes in a destructor.
- _Complexity_: The average case time complexity for search, insert, and delete 
  operations in a BST is O(log n), but in the worst case, it can degrade to O(n), 
  particularly in unbalanced trees.

In the distribution folder, we have provided four files:
1. __BinarySearchTree.hpp__ declares two templated classes: 
   - `BinarySearchTree` models a binary search tree. The class contains
     a link to the root node and then a variety of methods.
   - `Node` is a nested class in `BinarySearchTree` that represents a node. 
   `Node` contains the data element being stored and then two pointers to the 
   left and right children.
2. __main.cpp__ provides the main function. Add code to this file to validate your program.
4. __Makefile__ generates the `test` executable.


For this assignment, you will implement additional methods 
on the provided code for a binary search tree.

Specifically - 
- `size_t compute_height(Node *node);` // computes the height of the tree. This is the highest number of edges from the root node to a leaf node.
- `size_t countLeaves(Node* node) const;` // counts the number of leaves in a tree.  This is any node that does not have a child.
- `void inorder(Node* node, std::ostream& os) const;` // Performs an in-order traversal, printing(inserting) the node data element to the stream `os`.
   Each element should be separated by a space.
- `void preorder(Node* node, std::ostream& os) const;` // Performs an pre-order traversal, printing(inserting) the node data element to the stream `os`.
   Each element should be separated by a space.
- `void postorder(Node* node, std::ostream& os) const;` // Performs a post-order traversal, printing(inserting) the node data element to the stream `os`.
   Each element should be separated by a space.
- `size_t calculateHeight();`  // Implement functionality. Additionally, Â modify this method to throw `std::domain_error` if the tree is empty.
- `bool exists(T value) const;` // returns true if the value exists in the tree, false otherwise
- `void deleteValue(T value);`  // removes the node containing value if it exists.

## Removing a Node
Removing an existing node from a BST is one of the more complex operations for a BST.
You need to consider three possibilities:
1. Removing a leaf node
   - Update the parent link to the node to `nullptr`
   - Delete(free) the node
2. Node has a single child
   - Bypass the node by linking the parent to the child
   - Delete(free) the node
3. Node has two children.
   - Find the node's in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree).  
     Alternatively, you can find the node's in-order predecessor (the 
     largest node in the left subtree).
   - Swap the value of the node to be deleted with the in-order successor / predecessor.
   - Delete(free) the node that was the in-order successor/predecessor.  This 
     will either be a leaf node or a node with a single child.
     You should make a recursive call for this deletion. 
     `BinarySearchTree` has a method to find the minimum node from a given node.

In each case, you will also need to consider if the root node has been updated.
